📌 MARKETING PERFORMANCE OVERIVEW:

🧠 Overall Campaign Performance (Sep 2024 – through Dec 2024)

Positive growth: With over 5.2 million in sales and 514K leads, the campaign is on the right track, especially in expanding the potential customer base.

Conversion rate (CVR) at 4.01% indicates effective ad content and a well-functioning conversion funnel.

Strategic budget allocation: Balanced investment across objectives ensures full-funnel performance. A strong shift toward “Sales” (+58%) reflects a strategy to push revenue conversion in the mid-to-late stages.

Warning sign: A noticeable drop at the end of the period (as seen in the timeline chart) may signal issues—seasonality, budget depletion, or lower engagement.

# Initial stability, limited growth:

+ Budget was cautiously allocated, performance remained flat.

+ Achieved the highest CVR (4.07%), suggesting strong conversion potential.

+ However, lead volume was lowest across the 3-month period.

# Interpretation:

+ A stable launch indicates solid targeting and creative groundwork.

+ However, growth was constrained by conservative spending and lack of scale testing.

# Takeaway:

+ Momentum needs to be built through expanded targeting and iterative creative testing.

🧠 October 2024 – Optimization & Performance Uplift:

# Clear improvement trajectory:

+ After a quiet start, lead volume surged at month-end, leading to a 38.1% increase in purchases.

# Smart budget shift:

+ More investment was directed toward Conversions and Sales, improving funnel depth.

+ CVR remained strong and consistent at 3.97%.

# Interpretation:

+ This signals that previous learnings were effectively applied.

+ Audience refinement and budget reallocation delivered tangible results.

# Takeaway:

+ October serves as a benchmark month. Its strategic mix can guide future scaling.

🧠 November 2024 – Stabilization with Signs of Volatility:

# Overall stability, but cracks emerging:

+ Sales and CVR held steady, but Conversions budget dropped (-16.3%), leading to fluctuations in leads and purchases, especially in the final week.

+ Increased Sales spend (+10%), but purchase volume still declined toward month-end.

# Interpretation:

+ Content fatigue, delivery issues, or landing page performance may be impacting effectiveness.

# Takeaway:

+ Reinforce testing (e.g. A/B creatives, new audience segments).

+ End-of-month drop suggests need for better pacing or re-engagement strategies.
